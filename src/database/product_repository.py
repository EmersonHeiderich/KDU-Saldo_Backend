# src/database/product_repository.py
# Handles database operations related to products (if any beyond observations).

"""
NOTE: Currently, all product-related DB operations seem to be focused on
'product_observations'. These have been moved to `ObservationRepository`.

If there were other product-specific tables or data to manage locally
(e.g., cached product details, local product metadata), this repository
would handle those operations.

For now, this file can be kept as a placeholder or removed if no other
product-specific database logic is anticipated soon. If removed, ensure
no imports rely on it. Let's keep it as a placeholder demonstrating structure.
